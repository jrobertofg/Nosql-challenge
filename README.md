# NoSQL Challenge: UK Food Establishments Data Analysis
# Project Overview
The main idea of this is to use the UK Food Standards Agency evaluation for various establishments across the United Kingdom and gives them a food hygiene rating. 
You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.# Nosql-challenge
